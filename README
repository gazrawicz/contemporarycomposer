ContemporaryComposer is a project written for composers, that don't want to overwork themselves. CC generates score semiautomatically. 

Main goals:
- results should be unpredictable in microscale (randomized as much as possible)
- auditory effect could be unpleasant (CC doesn't focus on it)
- score should arouse curiosity (a contemporary composer should say "oh, that's interesting" when looking at score)
